# Data Warehousing Project On AWS Redshift

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description

In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

## How to run this project

- run `redshift.py` to create clients, IAM role, Cluster, attach policy to IAM role, open connection to TCP port, connect to database, update `dwh.cfg` file and connect to the database created.
- run `create_tables.py` to call sql queries in `sql_queries.py` to create tables: staging_events, staging_songs, songplays, users, songs, artists and time.
- run `etl.py` to load data from S3 to staging tables (staging_events, staging_songs) and then insert data from these staging tables to data warehouse (fact table: songplays, dimesional tables: users, songs, artists and time)


## Project Datasets
1. Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
    `song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`
    `song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`
2. Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
    `log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`
    `log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`


## Schema Selection

The following schema has been selected for the staging tables;

**Events Table**

* artist varchar
* auth varchar
* firstName varchar 
* gender varchar 
* itemInSession integer
* lastName varchar 
* length double precision
* level varchar
* location varchar 
* method varchar
* page varchar 
* registration double precision
* sessionId integer
* song varchar
* status integer
* ts bigint
* userAgent varchar
* user_id varchar

**Songs Table**

* artist_id varchar
* artist_latitude double precision
* artist_location varchar 
* artist_longitude double precision
* artist_name varchar 
* duration double precision
* num_songs integer
* song_id varchar 
* title varchar 
* year integer

With the above considerations, the following schema was selected for the fact, and dimension analytics tables;

### Fact Table: songplays 
records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
columns: songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimesional Tables
1. users - users in the app
columns: user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
2. songs - songs in music database
columns: song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
3. artists - artists in music database
columns: artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
4. time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
columns: start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
